# Stock Market App

This is a stock market application with a frontend built in React and a backend powered by Django.


To run this code, you would need to run the servers for both the frontend and backend

the frontend directory is utilizing Node.js and can be found in the "StockMarketApp/stockssim-frontend" directory 
The backend code is utilizing Django and can be found in the "StockMarketApp/stocksim-backend/manage.py" directory


Once both servers are running, the app can be access through the index.html or the link: http://localhost:3000/

From here you can view your Dashboard/Portfolio if you have an account, view the stock market, ask the chatbot for current prices on any specific stocks and account management
